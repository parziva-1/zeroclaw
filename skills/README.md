# Preloaded Skills

This directory contains preloaded, transparent skill bundles that ZeroClaw copies into each workspace's `skills/` directory during initialization.

Current preloaded skills:

- `find-skills` (source: https://skills.sh/vercel-labs/skills/find-skills)
- `skill-creator` (source: https://skills.sh/anthropics/skills/skill-creator)

These files are committed for reviewability so users can audit exactly what ships by default.
